<p>Wearable AR devices are being explored in many applications,  for obtaining real-time contextual  information  and  also  tele-assistance  from  remote sites.  Tele-assistance is useful in many industrial scenarios,  where  the on-field  operators  often  require  expertâ€™s  guidance for trouble shooting and touchless hand gestures are the most intuitive way to select the region of interest(ROI), for eg. to highlight the defective parts.  The selected region using freehand sketching gestures can be conveyed to the remote site.  We present a hand gestural interaction method to localise the ROI in First Person View(FPV). Novelty of the proposed method include (a) touch-less finger-based gesture recognition that runs on Android wearables including smartphones,  which in addition with frugal  modality  like <a href="https://vr.google.com/cardboard/">Google Cardboard</a> and <a href="http://wearality.com/">Wearality</a>,  can  be used as a wearable, (b) real-time performance achieved by  implementing  the  hand  gesture  recognition  module  on a smartphone and thus reducing the network latency.</p>

<p>We  present an  approach  for  marker-less  and  real-time touch-less gestures to mark ROI on wearables in FPV by proposing a novel two  stage  sequential  gesture  recognition  method as shown in the demo video.   First,  we  detect  a dynamic  gesture which involves detecting the presence of a stable hand , then raising the index finger with the rest of the fist closed(termed as point gesture) to trigger ROI Selection. This is followed by another dynamic gesture involving moving point gesture around the object of interest.   Our  approach  is  particularly  suitable  as  most  of  the smartphones available in the market are not equipped with built-in depth sensor posing additional challenges. The main blocks of the algorithm are: (i)point gesture detection, (ii) ROI selection, (iii) ROI tracking, and (iv) subsequent updating of bounding box around the ROI. Skin pixel detection followed by largest contour segmentation gives the hand region in the user's FOV. The fingertip is computed as the farthest point from the centroid of hand. After finger  tip  detection, a closed contour is drawn following the locus of the detected fingertip,  in the sequence of frames. After  the  ROI  is  selected,  the  resultant  bounding  box using an approach based on Shi-Tomasi feature points and optical flow vectors. The unreliable trajectories of the feature points are eliminated using the Forward-Backward Error method. 
We conducted experiments on  industrial which  demonstrates  that  the problem identification with our method of ROI highlighting gets faster by 70%, in comparison to sole audio instructions. </p>
