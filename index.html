<p>Wearable AR devices are being explored in many applications,  for obtaining real-time contextual  information  and  also  tele-assistance  from  remote sites.  Tele-assistance is useful in many industrial scenarios,  where  the on-field  operators  often  require  expertâ€™s  guidance for trouble shooting and touchless hand gestures are the most intuitive way to select the region of interest(ROI), for eg.to highlight the defective parts.  The selected region using freehand sketching gestures can be conveyed to the remote site.  We present a hand gestural interaction method to localise the ROI in First Person View(FPV). Novelty of the proposed method include (a) touch-less finger-based gesture recognition that runs on Android wearables including smartphones,  which in addition with frugal  modality  like <a href="https://vr.google.com/cardboard/">Google Cardboard</a> and <a href="http://wearality.com/">Wearality</a>,  can  be used as a wearable, (b) real-time performance achieved by  implementing  the  hand  gesture  recognition  module  on a smartphone and thus reducing the network latency.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/arc4224/AirGesturesROI/blob/master/img/Setup.png?raw=true?" alt="Proposed Method "></p>

<p>We propose a technique for hand gesture classification by categorising the hand motion in four type of swipes such as Up, Down, Left and Right which can be used for triggering different types of events which are intuitive for wearable AR/VR gadgets. We circumvent the shortcomings of the probabilistic models for hand detection by using a simpler palm detection model that works purely on <strong>Cb</strong> and <strong>Cr</strong> values using a statistical model. The step generates multiple blobs on the palm segment. Contour detection filters the blobs that are small and hence would not correspond to palm. A Shi-Tomasi detector based simple approach is applied for feature point detection on the contour boundary. The motion of these feature points is analysed by computing the optical flow based displacement. The aggregate measure of the displacement is used for labelling the swipe under major groups. The approach is computationally simple and can be run on an ordinary smart-phone. We demonstrate the performance of this approach on more than hundred of sample video segments with over <em>95%</em> classification accuracy. This technique can be easily integrated with many applications for the overlaid information traversal spanning multiple pages. </p>
